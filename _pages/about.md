👋 Welcome! I'm Ananyo Bhattacharya, a space scientist and engineer bridging scientific research with technological innovation. I am a Research Fellow at Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering, University of Michigan.

I am working on problems at intersection of natural sciences and engineering focused on understanding Earth and outer space. At University of Michigan's [Atmospheric Dynamics Modeling Laboratory](https://admg.engin.umich.edu), I work on technical development of [NOAA Unified Forecast System](https://ufs.epic.noaa.gov) for operational weather forecasting over the Great Lakes region. I am also working with applications of deep learning models for Earth System Modeling. Emerging technologies in machine learning combined with physics based methods help us to take on challenging problems.

As a scientific collaborator with [NASA Juno mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/), I have led projects focused on Microwave Radiometry applications to sensing Jupiter's deep clouds and its space environment. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering from University of Michigan with a Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, developing solutions for infant mortality in low-resource communities. I have also led and collaborated on a wide scale of collaborative projects from space mission design to community driven environmental monitoring. I have a professional experience of working as a research intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I have a undergraduate training in Mechnical Engineering from NIT Surat that helps me to connect the paradigms of science and engineering for positive impact.
