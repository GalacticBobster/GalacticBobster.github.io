👋 Welcome to my page! My name is Ananyo Bhattacharya, and I am pursuing my doctoral studies in planetary science. I am currently in my second year of doctoral studies at [Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research focuses on exploration of planetary bodies, and their space environments. I am interested in origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres, and understanding planetary bodies as a complex system. I am working with [NASA Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html) mission to Jupiter, to analyze Microwave Radiometer observations of Jupiter's deep atmosphere and auroral region.

🪐 My doctoral research focuses on coupling photochemistry of Venus with atmospheric dynamics driven transport processes to understand the spatio-temporal variability of trace species in Venus. The coupling between chemistry and dynamics offers a perspective to interpret the observations of ground based telescopes and spacecrafts in order to develop a better understanding of planetary atmospheres. 

🛠️ In addition to my scientific pursuits, I am fortunate to have been selected as a Fellow of the [Entrepreneur's Leadership Program](https://cfe.umich.edu/elp/). This program has provided me with a unique opportunity to develop my leadership skills, cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset, and gain insights into the world of business and innovation. Being part of this program has broadened my horizons and equipped me with the tools to translate my scientific expertise into real-world applications and make a tangible impact on society.
