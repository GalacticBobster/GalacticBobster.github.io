üëã Welcome to my page! My name is Ananyo Bhattacharya, and I am pursuing my doctoral studies in planetary science. I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research focuses on exploration of planetary bodies, and their space environments. I am interested in origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres, and understanding planetary bodies as a complex system. I am working with [NASA Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html) mission to Jupiter, to analyze Microwave Radiometer observations of Jupiter's deep atmosphere and auroral region.

ü™ê My doctoral research focuses on uaddressing two fundamental topics associated with Jupiter's origin, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process. Firstly, "**What inferences do Jupiter's deep atmosphere provide about its compositional gradient and it's effects on evolution of the planet ?**", and secondly, "**How do high-energy electron fluxes and their variability influence the state of Jupiter's high-latitude ionosphere ?**". Juno Microwave Radiometer instrument was designed to probe into the complex three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's weather layer and clouds. However, since its operation, it has lead to serendipitous discoveries of sub-solar alkali metals and microwave signatures of Jupiter's polar aurora.


ü™ê In addition to my scientific research, I am pursuing my interests in entrepreneurship, community science and technical innovation for social impact. Along with my doctoral program, I am pursuing a graduate certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at U-M. As a Fellow of the [Entrepreneur's Leadership Program](https://cfe.umich.edu/elp/) at University of Michigan, I had the opportunity to develop my leadership skills, cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset, and gain insights into the world of business and innovation. I have worked in association with [M-HEAL: The Initiative](https://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative) to develop neonatal incubators to combat infant mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, I serve as a Thriving Earth Exchange Community Science Fellow at American Geophysical Union.

üöÄAs an early career professional, I have served as student representative, and volunteered with various professional organizations like American Geophysical Unon, American Astronomical Society - Division for Planetary Sciences, and Space Generation Advisory Council.
